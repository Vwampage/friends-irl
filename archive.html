					<strong>MOLLY BRAMLET, PRODUCT Designer, Yello&nbsp; &#124; &nbsp;January 28th, 2018</strong><br> As someone with a degree in Art, I always thought user research and usability testing was for people with backgrounds in HCI, anthropology, or business strategy. Over the years as a product designer, I've come to integrate multiple types of research tools in to my scrappy design practice. I'd like to share with you all some basic tools and techniques, how you can implement it even without a research team, and the impact it can&nbsp;make!

					<strong>DAVID MICHAELS, Devops Engineer, SwipeSense&nbsp; &#124; &nbsp;September 19th, 2017</strong><br> From 2014 to 2017 I grew from being the office IT person to a devops engineer. Sometimes I was given great opportunities, sometimes I had to fight to learn or move throughout the company. I was given lots of help sometimes and dutifully ignored at others. In the end, I'm in a wholly different career than I expected to&nbsp;be.

					<strong>DAVID MICHAELS, Devops Engineer &nbsp; &#124; &nbsp;April 13th, 2016</strong><br> Most wifi networks start with a consumer access point (hello Wirecutter, who's the best this month?) and do just fine, but when the number of people increase and the space gets bigger things get complicated pretty quickly. David will tell the story of growing the wifi network at Signal from consumer grade access points through multiple sets of new hardware and an office move. Obstacles along the way include terminating cat-5e, mesh networking, noisy neighbors, hammer drills, and metaphors about speakers. Along the way he learned valuable lessons about ping times, friendship, and software&nbsp;updates.
